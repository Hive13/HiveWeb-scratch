# The New HiveWeb

This will be the main README for the new Hive intweb. I'm starting a todo list/task list here. 

This README will also serve (for now) as the main page for documentation.

### Thoughts and Ideas

Let's also have a place for thoughts and ideas, eh? 

--- 

* we should define what a bug report looks like
* we should define what a decent contribution looks like
* should we assign 1 or 2 people to review PRs before merging? Recurring meeting time instead?

---

### Tasks

- [ ] API route tree - will give us an idea of what routes we need and the functionality they'll provide
- [ ] boostrap new API (includes folder structure, framekwork adoption)
- [ ] backend unit testing

---

### Documentation

* something will go here soon, I promise.
